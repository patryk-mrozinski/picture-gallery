about: "I have a profound passion for capturing the beauty of nature and landscapes. My lens doesn't stop there; I'm equally drawn to ancient structures, churches, and tombs that echo tales of bygone eras. However, it's the rustic charm of the old countryside that holds a special place in my heart. Sun-kissed fields, quaint old cottages, small chapels, trees bursting into spring bloom, the intoxicating scent of lilacs, and tranquil ponds nestled beneath weeping willows. Words may fall short, but I aim to encapsulate this essence in my photographs. If you wish to infuse your home or office with a touch of this ambiance, I invite you to explore and purchase my work."
